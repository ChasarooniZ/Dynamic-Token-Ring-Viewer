## Dynamic Token Ring Maker
Use [this link](https://chasarooniz.github.io/Dynamic-Token-Ring-Viewer/) to make your own dynamic token ring sheet (you still need the JSON etc.)


Requires the following:
- Token Border (2048 px x 2048 PX)
- Token Background (2048 px x 2048 PX)
- The ring must have magenta coloring (based on the `Ring Bands` section of this [style guide](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dynamic-token-rings/)) so it has a place for the animations to go
